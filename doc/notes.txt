REFS AND PORTALS

-Accessing dom elements with REFS
-managing values with REFS
-exposing API functions from  components


//NB: - Whenever a ref changes the component function does not reExercute unlike the state.
      - state should be used whenever you have values that should be directly be shown on the UI
      - should not use state for values that are behind the scenes.

// PORTALS
- detaching DOM rendering from jsx using the PORTALS
- we will use createPortal from react-dom , createPortal () takes two arquements one being, the code you want to be relocated and the element you want your code to be kept
